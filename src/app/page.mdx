## About

Geostrategic is a large-scale massively-multiplayer online (MMO) real-time
strategy (RTS) sandbox game.

{/* ## Worlds

Each world is a separate instance of the game with its own map, players and
rules. Worlds goes through four lifecycle stages:

1. **Planned** — Plans for the world are being made, but development has not
   yet begun.
2. **Under Developement** — The world is being activly developed. Players can
   join the world for testing, but the world will be peridocially reset.
3. **Active** — Players can join the world. It will remain unchanged throughout
   its lifespan (with the exception of critial bugs fixes).
4. **Archived** — The world has reached the end of its lifespan and is no
   longer available to play, but can still be viewed.
